# This section controls the behavior of the logger.
[Logging]

	# Use this setting to change the level of detail captured by the logger.
	# The allowed values are:
	#	"trace"		This will capture everything the program does.
	#	"debug"		This prints out extra debug info, which can be useful in tracking bugs down.
	#	"info"		This is the default level. It will print out all useful information messages.
	#	"warn"		This level will ignore normal info messages, and will only print warnings or errors.
	#	"error"		This will ignore all messages except for program errors.
	#	"fatal"		This will ignore all messages, except for errors that cause the extension to crash.
	#	"off"		This will disable logging entirely.
	log-level = "trace"


# This section controls the way Q# comment blocks are generated.
[Comment-Structure]

	lines-between-sections = 2

	# This is the number of newlines between the subsections for individual parameters in the
	# Input section. The minimum is 1, and the default is 2.

# This section controls the Q# parser application that the extension uses to parse Q# code.
[Parser]

	# This is how long (in milliseconds) the extension will wait for the Q# parser application
	# to connect to it before deciding that it was a failure, and something went wrong.
